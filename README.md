## Project Statement

*A short, clear description of what this project is and why it exists.*
This should be understandable to someone outside the club in 2–3 sentences. Focus on the creative goal, not implementation details.

---

## Concept & Inspiration

What inspired this project? This can be an artwork, technology, question, or frustration.
Keep this lightweight — a paragraph or a few bullets is perfect.

---

## What This Project Does

Describe the current functionality of the project **as it exists now**.

* Core behavior or output
* What a user/viewer experiences
* Any notable creative or technical features

*(This section should naturally evolve as the project becomes more real.)*

---

## Current State

> Where the project stands today.

* ☐ Concept / exploration
* ☐ Prototype
* ☐ Working demo
* ☐ Polished experience

Optional: one sentence on what’s working and what’s still rough.

---

## Demo / Media

Add visuals as soon as possible — even rough ones.

* Screenshots
* Short clips
* GIFs
* Links to demos or recordings

*(A README with visuals always feels more “real.”)*

---

## How It’s Built (High-Level)

Describe the structure without locking into tools unless relevant.

* Platform / medium (e.g. interactive installation, web app, Unity experience)
* Key systems or components
* Any notable constraints or design decisions

Keep this readable to non-engineers.

---

## Future Directions

Where could this project go next?


* Features or ideas you’d add with more time
* Creative extensions
* Open questions or experiments

This is aspirational, not a commitment.

---

## Team

Project contributors.

* Name — focus or contribution
* Name — focus or contribution
